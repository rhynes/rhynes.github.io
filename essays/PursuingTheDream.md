At a young age I always found myself either outside on a baseball field or sitting at home on a computer playing video games on my parent’s computer. As time went on I moved toward console games like PlayStation and Xbox and I also made it on my high school varsity baseball team. Little did I know then that I would grow up and be able to peruse both my dreams of playing college baseball and studying computer science. I attended a couple University playing the game I love, and enjoying every moment of it till one day my career came short due to an elbow injury. I was forced to leave the school I was attending, which meant I could no longer study computer science. I felt like all was lost. After a long summer trying to figure out my next move I found myself in Hawaii going to school and back on my feet studying computer science. It was good to be back but the fact of not playing baseball anymore still to this day leaves a hole in my heart. But on a positive not this pushed me to put everything I got to perform to the best of my ability to learn the concepts of computer science and master the ability to perform any task bestowed before me. 

My interests in software engineering consist of: The ability to master JavaScript and other programing languages, learning new creative skills/ tactics to implement while creating my own software, and being able to learn more about all the capabilities that Software engineering has to offer so I am not limited to what I can accomplish in programming. I believe that this all possible and can be easily achieved with hard work and determination.

While learning more on Software engineering I hope to achieve many skills.  One of the most import skills I wish to learn is being able to work in a team atmosphere. Growing up I was always part of team sports but the only aspect that transfers over from there is the leadership skills I have acquired. A team atmosphere while programing takes a lot of collaboration and sharing of ideas to get things done, and I hope to learn the skills needed to be better at drawing up plans and becoming more organized to best help my future programming team. Another skill I wish to achieve is more experience in Cyber Security. I’m hoping I can learn more about the ins and outs of software engineering so when I make applications I can use proper guidelines to make my programs safe and secure.
