When it comes to coding standards I believe that following and learning the standards of a particular code can help improve quality and can actually help you learn a programming language. Coding standards are a set of guidelines for a specific programming language and without them programming languages would have no structure and readability. Following a codes coding standards can help you become more organized as well, and can make it easier if youâ€™re working in a team atmosphere for others to understand, maintain, and work with your code. From a learning perspective, implementing coding standards can help you learn the structure of how the code of a particular is written. This includes proper spacing, and indentation which also makes the code look very organized.

	After my first week of using ESLint and IntelliJ, I can say it has helped me a lot when it comes to writing clean and organized code. When first using IntelliJ with ESLint I was really confused to why I was getting certain errors with my code even though I knew my code was written correctly. What I found out was, was that a lot of errors had to do with the spacing of my curly brackets and mainly my code format. This made it hard at first for me to obtain a green checkmark, but after a few days of practicing proper coding standards getting a green check mark became very easy. ESLint is really good because it forces students like us to practice the proper styles of writing clean and organized code that makes it easier for others who are not familiar with our code to look it over and see what we have written. This can become very benefical later on in life when I am working in a team atmosphere and I have to write code for a project and other members of the group will easily be able to follow what I have coded due to the fact that I used proper coding standards that ESLint forces you to learn.
