A Smart question like the example above is a question that demonstrates precise and informative description of the problem occurring. For example in this question the developer asked a question regarding clarification on pointers in his code. The developer has shown in his question that he has done research, trial and error tests, and has provided all the material needed in order to make his question clear. In response he got two answers back that target and answer his specific question. 

[Example Of A Non Smart Question]( https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46110142/how-to-download-5th-version-of-turn-js)
A non-smart question like the example above is a great example of what not to post on a forum such as StackOverFlow. The question this user is asking is how to download a 5th version of turn.js. To start the developer that asked this question provided no information about the research she has done in order to complete her task. She also was not informative about what she is trying to do by downloading this program, and she hasnâ€™t even provided and steps she took in trying to pin down the problem at hand. Thus basically not showing any effort in order to try and solve the problem its self. What also makes this funny is that out of curiosity I decided to copy and paste her question into google and got a lot of information regarding her question. In the end this a non-smart question because of the lack of precise and informative information that included when asking a question.
In conclusion, software engineers need to develop great communication skills in order to provide and receive knowledgeable information about a specific topic. This includes developing smart question that provide precise and informative information regarding your question. Showing a willingness to learn by providing diagnostic steps, trial and error attempts, and providing research regarding your question can provide a great deal of help to other developers to potentially help solve your problems asked. If instead you ask a question for example on how to download google chrome this is considered to be a non-smart question and could easily be found on the web. Thus wasting the time of other developers.
