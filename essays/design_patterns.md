In the software engineering world today design patters have evolved as reusable solutions to the very problems us software engineers face
every day while programming. The purpose of design patterns is to provide a description or template to how software engineers can solve a
problem that can be used in many different situations, and in many cases, can be formalized best practices that us programmers can use to
solve common problems when designing any system or application. For example, Java contains   three categories of design patterns, which
are creational, structural, and behavioral patterns. Essentially, design patterns are very similar to keeping your work space such as your
desk organized and clean. If your desk is messy and dirty, you will encounter problems such as not enough working space, and your work
performance could be slow due to papers and information being out of place and thrown all over. 

When it comes to using design patterns, personally I could say I have implemented them quite a bit when working on my final group project
for my ICS 314 software engineering class. With the use of GitHub, and constantly working on code in a group atmosphere, with constant
pushes to issues created on our repo, it’s important to be very descriptive when pushing your finished code to the master. For example, if
for every commit I made to an issue in my code was very weak when it came to my description, then my partners I’m working with would not
be able to adequately understand what changes I made to the code. Thus, they may implement something I have already done making our code
messy and unorganized. Other examples include the structure in which code is written and in many of my projects throughout my computer
science classes at the University of Hawaii, I have practiced proper design patterns to make my code work fast and efficiently.
