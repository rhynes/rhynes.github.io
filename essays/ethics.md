When it comes to ethics there are a variety of things to consider from different standpoints to determine if something or someone is
considered to be morally correct. When working or doing anything in today’s society, there are a natural set of rules and standards that
have to abided by when participating in life. Now comes the question of how the standards of ethics can be applied in the world of
software engineering. In the world of software engineering, software engineers have the power to make other people’s dreams become a
reality when it comes to the design and development of software and other applications. This includes creating software for businesses,
personal enjoyment, work, and even for personal benefit. Even though there is a variety of ways that software engineers can implement
their talent, there is still a software code of ethics that must be taken into consideration when performing any type of software
creation. In my opinion, the most important ethical standpoint that all software engineers must consider when creating software is that
all software engineers should maintain a strong independent judgement, while also keeping the public’s interest in mind as well. 
This means that if a software engineer is creating software that could potentially cause harm or be considered not morally correct, they
need to assess the situation and make an ethical decision. This will ensure that they do not commit an unethical act of engineering.

	With my definition and opinion of ethics in mind, after reading the “The Code I’m Still Ashamed Of”, I believe that the
programmer was in the right and should not be ashamed due to the fact that his actions were still considered to be ethical. The problem
that occurred for the programmer was that he was asked to do a job of creating a quiz online that targeted young girls, and would give
them information about drugs they could take. The programmer was provided with little information on the drug the company was selling,
and later found out after the launch of his application he made for this medical company that a young girl had committed suicide using
the drug the company made. The programmer had no idea that the drug had side affects for suicidal thoughts and depression and found
himself feeling responsible for the death of the young girl. After spending more time thinking about what had happened the programmer
later separated from the company due to the fact that he believed that the company’s intentions were unethical.

In conclusion to the “The Code I’m still Ashamed Of”, I believe that what the programer did was still considered to be ethical due to
the fact that he came to the conclusion that the company’s intentions were not morally correct. When writing the code for the medical
company he had no idea that the drug he was advertizing in his quiz had side affects that could potentially cause death to another
individual. The programmer coming to a realization that the company is not moving in an ethical direction for the people and leaving the
company was an ethical decision on his part. Case studies such as the “The Code I’m still Ashamed Of”, are really good examples of
determining ethical or unethical actions, and as long a software engineer can make proper ethical judgement and keep the public,s
interest in mind at the same time, then making ethical decisions will be very easy to make.
