After the first couple weeks of being introduced and using Meteor I could say I have had some ups and downs when it comes to using meteor.
Two problems I have had with meteor so far is that for one being a complete noob with using meteor and not completely understanding how to
use it, and the second problem being that meteor is not the best when running it on windows platforms. When we first got introduced to
using meteor I had no experience with running meteor, and no idea what the basic commands were needed to use meteor to the fullest. The
way I got around this problem was by watching my professors screen casts, which give some really good insight on what meteor is, and how
to execute commands to get meteor up and running correctly. I wouldn’t say I am now a pro at meteor, but I do have a better understanding
of basic functions.

The Second problem that I have encountered and quite frankly I believe its holding me back a little, is that I’m using windows 10 platform
and I have noticed that meteor its self is not too friendly to users who prefer windows. Some problems I have encountered is that invoking
certain files takes a very long time. So long that it seems like something has gone wrong and causes me to restart the invoking process
making the whole process itself even longer. I still have yet to come to a solution for this problem but I am coming to the conclusion
that it must just be because of the windows platform.

Despite the problems and challenges I have encountered while using meteor, I am really enjoying using meteor. I believe there is still a
lot I need to still learn when it comes to using meteor, but with more practice I believe it will become easier to use and the end result
will be really satisfying when I will be able to make really cool websites.
