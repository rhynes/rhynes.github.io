Coming into ICS 314 I was a complete newbie at JavaScript.  After the first couple classes and our first assignment, which was an online 10
hour JavaScript code camp, my confidence and understanding of JavaScript boosted because of the simplicity compared to other programming
languages such as Java, C and C++.  So far I believe JavaScript is a very basic programming language and is pretty easy to pick up with
consistent practice. JavaScript to me is more enjoyable than another languages because there seems to be less rules involved and the code
its self looks a lot shorter and cleaner to use then other languages such as Java and C.

In ICS 314 we also partake in athletic software engineering. Athletic software engineering is a timed quiz where students are presented a
problem and must solve the problem in JavaScript in a limited amount of time or you don’t pass the assignment. In my opinion I can see how
this style of learning could be beneficial in forcing students to be more active in practicing JavaScript, but at the same time it is very
stressful and could also lead students into bad habits of code writing. There are practice WODS available but the environment is a little
less stressful which, allows the students to have a calmer mind set knowing there is no penalty on their grade for not finishing on time.
Personally, I believe athletic software engineering could work for me, but it will take some time to get use too because of the fact that I
don’t like to be rushed when righting code, and a stress free environment is helpful when programming.
