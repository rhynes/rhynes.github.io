This past couple weeks in ICS 314 we have been using Meteor to create and design websites and applications. Meteor to me at first was a 
complete headache. I had problems form the start, when it came to running and invoking things on meteor, but I came to the conclusion that
this was because of the fact I was using windows. For some reason windows and meteor were a pain to use together, and it didn’t help when
the screen casts we were watching on how to use meteor were all Mac based. With time though I became more comfortable with meteor, and I
started to learn the basics by spending more time using and practicing basic functions. 

The first introduction to meteor we did in class was working on an application called Digits. In digits we learned a number of things, one
being how to create and add a contact page. From this page users could add their first and last name, address, telephone, and email and
store that new contact on a home page. The one thing I really liked about meteor was the auto refresh to be able to see our creations
live. The refresh was fast and consistent. Another great feature that I really enjoyed about meteor is the fact that when I encountered an
error, meteor would refresh and tell me I encountered an error, then show me a direct path to where the error occurred. 

Overall, meteor in my opinion has its ups and downs.  At first meteor was really hard and confusing to me because of the fact that I was a
complete noob to meteor. What also didn’t help was that meteor was not too friendly to windows platforms and it was hard to adjust and
learn how to run properly on windows. Though with time and practice, I was able to overcome many challenges while using meteor. After the
past couple weeks of using meteor, I can see how it could be very beneficially for software engineers, and I’m happy to say with the help
of my professors screen casts, I am now way more comfortable with using meteor.
