	This week in ICS 314 we learned how to use Ui frameworks such as Semantic Ui. Semantic Ui is a modern front end development
framework that has a sleek, subtle, and flat design look that provides a lightweight user experience. We used semantic Ui to design and
recreate web pages that contain a menu bars, images, dropdown menus, icons, footers, and proper formatting.  The reason why we use
Frameworks such as Semantic UI is because we reach a whole new level of creative abilities when it comes to web page development. Semantic
UI comes preset with many abilities which makes developing websites easier. Even though using frameworks is more frustrating than using
raw HTML and CSS, itâ€™s a good tool to learn because it saves software engineers a lot of time and makes developing web pages a lot
simpler. 

	When it comes to my experience of learning Semantic Ui I would describe it as challenging at first, but well worth it in the end.
Using frameworks such as Semantic Ui is just as hard to learn to as a whole new programing language to me. What makes it somewhat
difficult is actually learning all the abilities that Semantic Ui provides for its users. But it is also easy to find many guides and
examples online, which can be found on their website. After using Semantic Ui for just a week I would say I am very comfortable in being
able to say I can develop and recreate just about any style format of webpage possible, and that is just because of the concise and easy
to learn behaviors that trigger functionality that Semantic Ui has to offer.
