summary: I have been working on a new social media aplication that allows for users to create personal virtual cliques with their friends, coworkers, employees, following, etc.

Clique is a social media application that is still in the development phase, but is looking to possibly be released by late 2018. I came up with the application concept Clique by looking for a place where I can keep in contact with friends with out having to deal with ad spam/ news feed spam that is constantly seen today in Facebook and Twitter. Clique will provide users with the ability to have a private group that conceals the identity of all users granted permission by the group admin.
