During my first semester at the Univsersity of Hawaii my first programming class I took was ICS 111 Introduction To Java. Our final project for the class was to take everything we have learned in the class and use our creativity to recreate or create a new video game. My favorite childhood game just happened to be Frogger so I chose that for my project. Using Java I was able to create the frogger game using my own graphics and images that I made in photoshop.
