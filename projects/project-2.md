A Raspberry Pi is a very cool miniature computer that can be used for a variety of things. One issue that I was having in my room was that
I would be laying in bed about to go to sleep and I would forget to turn off my fan and fan light. So I would always have to get out of
bed and flip the switch to turn it off. SO one day I decided to install a blue tooth reciever to replace the fan switch on the wall and
add bluetooth lights inside the fan. I then transformed my rasberry pi by installing a touch screen to it and installed a bluetooth remote
to it to control my fans speed, power, light power, and light brightness.
