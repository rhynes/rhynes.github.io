Math with Friends is an online game that makes learning math fun for students.

For many students at University of Hawaii at Manoa, math is not their most favorite subject in school.
For example, you can hear the students grumbling when you pass by the school's algorithm classes. The intent of
Math with Friends is to motivate these students to enjoy learning math. It aims to give them better
practice at math concepts, motivation, and the insight that even math can be sometimes fun.

The scope of the problems given is restricted to math at the moment for simplicity's sake, but the vision
is that we would extend Math with Friends in the future to encompass a variety of subjects offered in school.
Also, the population of the users should not be limited to students at the University of Hawaii
at Manoa, but eventually include students from many different schools around the state.
